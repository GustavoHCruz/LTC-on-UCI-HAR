# Liquid Time Constant Applyed on UCI-HAR

This project aims to implement a simple liquid neural network applied to the UCI-HAR dataset.

The dataset UCI-HAR was downloaded from [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones).

More info about the LTC and its documentation is available in [Neural Circuit Policies](https://ncps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) library site or in [Ramin Hasani GitHub](https://github.com/raminmh/liquid_time_constant_networks).
