# Liquid Time Constant Applyed on UCI-HAR

This project aims to implement a simple liquid neural network applied to the UCI-HAR dataset.

The dataset UCI-HAR was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drsaeedmohsen/ucihar-dataset).

More info about the LTC and its documentation is available in [Neural Circuit Policies](https://ncps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) library site or in [Ramin Hasani GitHub](https://github.com/raminmh/liquid_time_constant_networks).
